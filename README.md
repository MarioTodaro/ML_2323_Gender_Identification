#Project Description
This project focuses on developing a classifier to identify gender (male or female) from high-level features representing face images. Such tools can be applied, for example, as preprocessing for gender-dependent face recognition models.

The provided dataset consists of image embeddings: low-dimensional representations of face images mapped to a common manifold (typically a few hundred dimensions) using neural networks. For simplicity, synthetic data is used, and the embeddings have significantly lower dimensionality compared to real-world use cases.
